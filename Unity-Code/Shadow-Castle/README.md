# Shadow Castle
This is a project I worked on my freshman year at Digipen. 
It was orignally written with C Processing but I've decided to recreate the game in Unity in 2024.
A video of the original game can be seen on my [Portfolio](https://gibson-hougland.notion.site)
As soon as the Unity remake is done I plan on publishing it on a few platforms and having a web build of it on my portfolio.
I've restructured how various levels are saved by writing an inspector tool to reserialize the text files into a JSON format.
All code has been rewritten from the ground up in Unity by me.
